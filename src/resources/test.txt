People do not often interact with their neighbours and this can be harmful for building communities.
What are the possible causes and how can this be solved? ⠀
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.


Nowadays, when the population of big cities is growing fast,
less and less people continue communicating with their neighbors.
With too many people living in one block of flats,
it’s become extremely difficult to get to know them all.
Even if someone wants to start any relations,
they need to find reasons for getting acquainted.
This causes several problems, but the case isn’t hopeless –  there are possible solutions as well.
First of all, people forget, how to show sympathy to any person besides their relatives,
they can’t come around to help their neighbor with a baby for a while.
That’s because of the cultural changes – it’s not “up-to-date” to help anyone unknown anymore.
To overcome it, parents should teach their children, how to take care of other people,
and these children will succeed in building relations afterwards.
Moreover, people don’t care about their neighborhood.
It’s easier to damage something, leave waste or vandalize
if you don’t know those who surround you – you feel less responsibility
since spoiling anything means only ruining a thing – not causing inconvenience for homemates and neighbors.
The attitude to the public belongings can be changed by involving people living at a concrete place in designing them,
for instance. A good example of this was made a couple of years ago by my friend’s granny.
When children from the next door dug flowers she had planted in front of the house for the second time,
her patience came to an end. She called them right into the flat and offered to choose and plant anything together.
Children were skeptical at first, but later all the flowerbeds remained untouched!
Last but not least, some of the neighbors have an extremely irritating habit: they are never saying hello!
This is a lack of bringing up, but people forget elementary politeness and etiquette rules –
this can spoil their work interviews in future, can affect that they’ll seem less charismatic to others.
It’s necessary to teach children to be polite with neighbors – and then they will transfer it to their life.
In conclusion, bad relations with neighbors are not a local problem – it may affect life seriously.
Thus there are some possible options to improve the situation:
let people put themselves into building relations – and they will start appreciating the results.
